IN THE BEGINNING there was a river. The river became a road and the road branched out to
the whole world. And because the road was once a river it was always hungry.
In that land of beginnings spirits mingled with the unborn. We could assume numerous forms.
Many of us were birds. We knew no boundaries. There was much feasting, playing, and
sorrowing. We feasted much because of the beautiful terrors of eternity. We played much
because we were free. And we sorrowed much because there were always those amongst us who
had just returned from the world of the Living. They had returned inconsolable for all the love
they had left behind, all the suffering they hadn’t redeemed, all that they hadn’t understood, and
for all that they had barely begun to learn before they were drawn back to the land of origins.
There was not one amongst us who looked forward to being born. We disliked the rigours of
existence, the unfulfilled longings, the enshrined injustices of the world, the labyrinths of love,
the ignorance of parents, the fact of dying, and the amazing indifference of the Living in the
midst of the simple beauties of the universe. We feared the heartlessness of human beings, all of
whom are born blind, few of whom ever learn to see.
Our king was a wonderful personage who sometimes appeared in the form of a great cat. He had
a red beard and eyes of greenish sapphire. He had been born uncountable times and was a legend
in all worlds, known by a hundred different names. It never mattered into what circumstances he
was born. He always lived the most extraordinary of lives. One could pore over the great
invisible books of lifetimes and recognise his genius through the recorded and unrecorded ages.
Sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, he wrought incomparable achievements from every life.
If there is anything common to all of his lives, the essence of his genius, it might well be the love
of transformation, and the transformation of love into higher realities.
With our spirit companions, the ones with whom we had a special affinity, we were happy most
of the time because we floated on the aquamarine air of love. We played with the fauns, the
fairies, and the beautiful beings. Tender sibyls, benign sprites, arid theserenepresences of our
ancestors werealways withus,bathingusintheradiance of their diverse rainbows. There are many
reasons why babies cry when they are born, and one of them is the sudden separation from the
world of pure dreams, where all things are made of enchantment, and where there is no suffering.
